# TypeScript

Is an ``open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft``. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). There are multiple options available for transcompilation.
